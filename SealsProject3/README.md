Rideforce, the ride-share app, is a full-stack <strong>Microservices</strong> application that allows riders access to a curated list of opted-in drivers, ranking matches based on physical proximity, comparable scheduling, and a rider's option of liking or disliking a driver. Information accessible to users includes preferred contact information, a photograph, a description of driver vehicle, and an optional bio. Application has three tiers of user roles: admin, trainer, and associate. 
The individual services use <strong>Spring Boot</strong> along with <strong>Spring Cloud Netflix</strong>, and Matching Service relies on <strong>Feign Client</strong> to gather relevant data for the matching algorithm. Testing is implemented using <strong>Spring Boot Test</strong>, which includes <strong>JUnit</strong> and <strong>Data JPA Test</strong>. Code quality is ensured via <strong>SonarLine</strong> and <strong>SonarCloud</strong>, logging is implemented via <strong>LogBack</strong>, and documentation is managed by <strong>JavaDocs</strong>.
